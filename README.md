# WhatToEat
WhattoEat is an application designed to help people choose what food to eat. The user spins a wheel, and the computer chooses what food the user should eat. Selected foods are chosen via a list that can be edited by a user. The food result includes a link to a Yelp search results page, which helps the user find the food they want to eat.
